# Drag And Drop Multiple Files
Drag and Drop multiple files into the file list, and hit Execute to run a command on each file.

![Program interface](_Screenshot.png)

Requires .net 4.7

Remembers the path to the exe and the parameters.

Replaces the filename parameter from the program to be run with %FILENAME in the parameters

I wrote this just so I didn't have to keep typing out multiple paths to files, or make a batch file to process each group of files I wanted to run a command line program on.
